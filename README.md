I know, its such a generic thing to do, library management system. 
Well what can I say, I just thought maybe it will be cool if i did generic stuff but put a lot of effort on it.

The result was good but I wont get back the time that i wasted on this.
If anyone sees this and bothers to use it, please make your own judgement.

Create a Database called exos on your xampp mysql dbms.
